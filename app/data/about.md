#### Intro
I'm a DACA recipient, TAMU Alumna, and software engineer. I'm passionate about advocating for the underserved and underrepresented, as well as solving problems for them. Technology has given me so much opportunity so I hope to use my technical background to provide opportunities for others. I'm available to do interviews, speak at events, consult interesting projects, offer advice, or just talk - feel free to [reach out](/contact).
<!-- <br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in New York but travel to the San Francisco Bay Area frequently. -->
<br><br>
#### Currently
I recently moved to Seattle from the [RGV](https://www.welcomehomergv.com/) to start my career as a Software Engineer at [Qualtrics](https://qualtrics.com).

<!-- At Arthena I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [arthena.com](https://arthena.com)). -->
